# Banking-System-Simulator
This project allows users to manage a virtual banking system, including opening accounts, checking balances, and making transactions, for a hands-on experience. It replicates key banking functions like account management and financial transactions. Error handling prevents invalid inputs and overdrafts, ensuring smooth, secure operation.
